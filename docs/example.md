# About this file
This file is a markdown bubbles config file.  It's job in life is 3-fold.
1. to describe itself - in  human reabable way
2. to describe it's format - in a machine parsable way including version for API compatibility
3. to to provide content in the afore described format - in a machine parsable way

Machine parsing is used to turn this file into a visualization diagram.  So, for example, I can write markdown that can be [fed into D3 to become a mind map diagram](http://bl.ocks.org/jdarling/2d4e84460d5f5df9c0ff).  But it also can be a readable standard markdown document.
