## 🚀 What is `mdbub`?

`mdbub` lets you build and manage mindmaps directly in your terminal. It's designed for speed-of-thought capture, with two streamlined modes: one for lightning-fast inline edits, and one for full-screen TUI visual editing.

Unlike plain Markdown, `mdbub` lets you *structure* your ideas—navigate, fold, tag, and rework them instantly, using only your keyboard.

## 🧨 Killer Features

- **Quick Mode**: Instant mini-editor for rapid note capture.
- **Edit Mode**: Full-screen terminal interface for folding, searching, tagging.
- **Keyboard-native UX**: Everything is hotkey driven. Customize to your liking.
- **Pipe Mode (coming soon)**: Interoperable with the rest of your CLI stack.
- **Zero-mouse flow**: It's not just fast. It feels *alive* under your fingertips.

## 💡 Example

```bash
mdbub quick
```

📍 Create nodes like this:

```
+ Redesign onboarding
    > Reduce required fields
    > Test single-click trial start
```

Then…

```bash
mdbub edit
```

🧠 Visualize and restructure effortlessly:

```
📌 Redesign onboarding
├── 🧩 Reduce required fields
├── 🧪 Test single-click trial start
└── 💡 Merge with growth campaign idea
```

Search with `/`, fold nodes with space, tag with `#`, and navigate instantly.
